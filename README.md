# Mahala - The Neighbourhood Lending App

The Romanian word 'mahala' originates from the Arabic ŸÖÿ≠ŸÑÿ© (‚Äòm√§hall√§‚Äô), brought to the Balkans by the Ottoman Empire (‚Äòmahalle‚Äô). It means 'neighborhood'.

-----

## What is it?

Mahala is an app to facilitate the sharing of things between neighbours.

### Features
#### Inventory
![[images/Inventory.png|250]]

Add the items you're willing to lend, for free or a price. Only your **nearby** neighbors will be able to see them. 


### Login/Registration
![[Pasted image 20250113061639.png|250]] ![[Login_Reg.gif|250]]

Every user must register with their **home address** and have it **verified** before they can access the content. This is crucial to ensure that everyone can only see their "neighbours" and no other users.
Currently, home address verification has not been implemented.
**Potential solutions include**:
* Decentralised, community verification: A random subset of verified users in the area is selected to verify a new user's Proof of Address. If there aren't enough verified users in the area, then perhaps a larger group could be selected from anywhere in the same country. A high consensus threshold must be reached to successfully register a new user.
* Explore methods used by government entities to verify address using Proof of Address documents.
* Multiple sources of evidence required e.g. call + Proof of Address document
#### Progress
* UI and backend for Login and Registration
#### To Do:
* **Should**: Federated registration (Sign-in with Google)
* **Must**:  Home Address verification (see above)
* **Must**: Forgot Password 
* **Must**: Email Address verification
### Market

See if your neighbors
#### Progress
* UI prototype is largely complete
* Integration with backend and S3 image storage 
#### To Do
* **Must**: Search logic on the backend. Currently it retrieves all items within a 1000 miles X|
* **Should** : Implement Category Filtering on the backend
* **Should**: Sort By
* **Should**: Visual Design and Layout improvements
* **Maybe** "Nearby" criteria improvements
### Chat

### üåÄ Future Ambitions

"By the community, For the community" 

---


I envision an app to facilitate democratic decision making within communities.
Local decision-making has the unrivaled advantages of being very specific and highly representative of the stakeholders of that space.
When there aren't countless bureoucratic hoops to go through, works gets done quickly and efficiently, as the progress is transparent to the scrutiny of every member of the community.

For matters like:
* Voting on, raising funds and resources for a local project like a public facility, volunteering work, cleaning, tree etc
