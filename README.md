# Mahala - The Neighbourhood Lending App

The Romanian word 'mahala' originates from the Arabic محلة (‘mähallä’), brought to the Balkans by the Ottoman Empire (‘mahalle’). It means 'neighborhood'.

-----

## What is it?

Mahala is an app to facilitate the sharing of things between neighbours.

The ladder you're looking for may just be 2 doors down.

### Features
#### Inventory

Add the items you're willing to lend, for free or a price. Only your **nearby** neighbors will be able to see them i.e. within a certain radius(TBD) of your address. 


### Login/Registration

Every user must register with their **home address** and have it **verified** before they can access the content. This is crucial to ensure that everyone can only see their "neighbours" and no other users.

Currently, home address verification has not been implemented.

The planned first solution is for the user to submit a video of themselves and a live video of an eligible Proof of Address document. These will be verified by a staff member.

**Potential future solutions**:

* Decentralised, community verification: A random subset of verified users in the area is selected to verify a new user's Proof of Address. If there aren't enough verified users in the area, then perhaps a larger group could be selected from anywhere in the same country. A high consensus threshold must be reached to successfully register a new user.

### Market

### 🌀 Future Ambitions

"By the community, For the community" 

---


I envision an app to facilitate democratic decision making within communities.
Local decision-making has the unrivaled advantages of being very specific and highly representative of the stakeholders of that space.
When there aren't countless bureoucratic hoops to go through, works gets done quickly and efficiently, as the progress is transparent to the scrutiny of every member of the community.

For matters like:
* Voting on, raising funds and resources for a local project like a public facility, volunteering work, cleaning, tree etc
